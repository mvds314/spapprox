# Saddle point approximation

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This module includes code for saddle point approximation

Saddle point approximations can be used to approximate distributions when you know their cumulant generating function.

We follow the approach outlined in: Ronald W Butler (2007): "Saddlepoint Approximations with Applications"

```python
import numpy as np
#TODO: put example here
```
